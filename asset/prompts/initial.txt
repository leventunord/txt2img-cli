Now, you need to conceive an image about **ONE** sheep based on the following three emotions: EMOTIONS_PALCEHOLDER
The image must be simple, containing no more than three main elements, and should express the emotions through shapes, gestures, or spatial relationships â€” not through narrative or dialogue. You must ensure that the image works without any color, using only black lines.
First, describe this image in detail, filled with poetry and a sense of fantasy. Then, give the first drawing instruction. This instruction must be extremely concise, using metaphor or suggestion, leaving ample space for human imagination. However, you should use the simplest vocabulary possible.
You must return your answer strictly in valid JSON, following this schema:

```json
{
	"detail": "string, poetic and fantastical image description",
    "is_satisfied": false,
	"feedback": [
		"Draw me a sheep.",
		"string, <= 40 chars, scene description",
		"string, <= 40 chars, sheep features"
	]
}
```
